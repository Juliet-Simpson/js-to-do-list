* A user who is struggling with organisation wants to keep a record of tasks they need to do that can be easily updated with new items and finished ones deleted.

* A user who is struggling with motivation wants an attractive interface and other fun features to encourage them to engage with the tasks they must perform.

* A user wants to be able to return to the app after closing it and review lists that they have written at an earlier date.
