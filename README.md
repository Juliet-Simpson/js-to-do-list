# JavaScript To Do List

A web-based To-Do-List app for Code-Institute's Fullstack Developer Diploma Milestone Two project.

## User Stories

* A user who struggles with keeping manually written to-do lists is looking for an automated alternative on their devices.

* A user who is struggling with organisation wants to keep a record of tasks they need to do that can be easily updated with new items and finished ones deleted.

* A user who is struggling with motivation wants an attractive interface and other fun features to encourage them to engage with the tasks they must perform.

* A user wants to be able to return to the app after closing it and review lists that they have written at an earlier date.

* Two users wish to use the app from the same device and would like to each be able to access their own list.

* A user would like to be able to keep multiple lists within the app.

* A user would like to obtain information about the weather in their location at the same time as reviewing their things-to-do.

* A user would like to see the deadline for things to be done on a calendar.

## UX

### **1. Strategy**

To create a to do list app that meets the needs of the user stories.

### **2. Scope**

Potential features to include:

PREFERRED
* Text box to add items to the list.
* Option to order list items using a drag and drop API.
* Date and time.
* Option to strike-through completed items.
* Option to delete items.
* To-do lists locally saved so that they can be retrieved after a users first visit.
* Option to change overall colour scheme.
* 'Done!' GIF and sound when a task is complete.
* Option to highlight urgent items in red.
* Option to name lists and create multiple lists symaltaneously.
* List of lists that can be retrieved.
* Connect to a weather API to give current weather information.

POSSIBLE

* Connect to a calendar API to log deadlines.
* Option to log in using Facebook.
* Option to edit list items.
* Option to add deadline and or extra info (phone numbers etc) to a list item.

### **3. Structure**

* The app will be all on one page.  
* It will be responsive for different screen sizes and the layout will vary slightly accordingly.  
* The header will contain the colour scheme selection options, page title, the date and time, a text box to name the list OR the title of the list currently displayed with a new list button.  
* List titles will display in a column to the left of the screen on desktop and tablet or in a dropdown menu on mobile.  
* The to do list items will be displayed centrally on the screen with a 'done' checkbox to the left and urgent and a trash button icons to the right of each item. 
* The 'enter a to-do' textbox will be central at the bottom of the page or list section so that it does not interfere with the list. 
* The weather API will be to the right of the screen on a desktop and below the list section on a tablet and a mobile.
